      This is a flowchart of the major path of Minecraft, from beginning to "the
      End", facing the Ender Dragon.

      Steve starts at the top-left. Complete all steps in each colored area
      before proceeding to the next.

    <ol>
      <li>Green: Get a foothold; should only take a few minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Yellow: Gather food and some supplies from the surface; always make a
        bed as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li>Orange: Mine, craft, and enchant; build a Nether Portal.</li>
      <li>
        Red: The Nether - find a Warped Forest (green biome) and farm Endermen,
        then find a Nether Fortress and farm Blazes.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If pre 1.16 there are no Warped Forest; instead get what Ender
            Pearls you can, but finish collecting them back in the Overworld by
            running around deserts at night.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Purple: Find a <a href="strongholds.html">Stronghold</a>, and activate the End Portal.</li>
      <li>
        Blue: The End - slay the Ender Dragon. Bring your enchanted gear, a bow
        and arrows, a single Ender Pearl, a stack of cooked meat, a bucket of
        water, and Golden Apples (optional).
      </li>
