  Fan site for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_(video_game)">NES Metroid</a> game. (and maybe Super Metroid later)

  <p>
    I've only played through the first 3 games, and then recently the latest (main) game.

    <dd>Good game. For years its password system haunted me, since I had been totally unable to crack it -- but no more! :)</dd>
    <dt>Metroid II</dt>
    <dd>Good times in the car on Gameboy as a child, but I think I would be disappointed if I played this again.</dd>
    <dt>Super Metroid</dt>
    <dd>Great game, the second game (after The Legend of Zelda) which inspired me to create a game-map.</dd>
    <dt>Metroid Dread</dt>
    <dd>Great game in many ways, but I have issues with it genre-breaking my expectations. To be fair, I skipped over decades of changes in the industry/series, but it seems to me the developers decision to emphasize speed-running and "dread mode" over classic metroid-vania exploration was a poor one.</dd>

      <p>The Super Metroid map which I hand-created with primitive image editors in the mid 90's:</p>

      <p>I first found slightly older iterations hosted here:</p>
      <a href="https://jansenprice.com/metroid/met3_sm/">https://jansenprice.com/metroid/met3_sm/</a>
      <p>Although I think they did not get them from me directly, since one is a JPG with lossy compression;
      I recall even then my dislike of the noise it creates.
      I believe I only stored them as BMP or GIF, since I certainly did not know about PNG at that time.
      Subsequently found the "final version" which I created (yup it's a GIF) hosted at <a href="https://imgur.com/n13rJav">imgur.com/n13rJav</a>; such an annoying website but whatever.
      I just stored as a PNG</p>
