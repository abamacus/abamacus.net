Keep your bed and boat
Enderman - use boat, or stand in water. If 1.16 go to Warped Forest in Nether.
Shield first
Jump when striking
Horse for overworld hunting
Glassed in Nether Fortess paths
Fastest XP: Nether mining, breeding(from farming), mining with instant break to smelt and trade
Cured villagers are better
Combine books with anvil; maximum combine number is all that matters.
Offhand with junk block when mining
Mending from a single villager
Elytra only good with fireworks, best with Unbreaking and Mending, and full maps; fireworks work underwater if never landed
One piece Golden armor in Nether (except in Fortress)
End exploring, get a Lodestone compass
Ender Dragon - make a lake with Depth Strider is best; crossbow easier to shoot crystals

        Always set your render distance to the maximum value that does not cause
        lag/stuttering, for whatever activity you are doing.
